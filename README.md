Tourist Attractions
Whenever we are travel it is fun to make a list of places we want to visit. The application looks at making this list and organizing locations into 3 categories: recommended places to visit, decided places to visit and places that have been visited. Within each category there will be the option to move a location up to the next category and also remove a location. Lastly, there is also the option to add new locations to any of the categories.
